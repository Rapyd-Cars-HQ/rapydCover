      <h5>11.1.1 Privacy Settings</h5>

        The Privacy Settings menu in the RAPYD rider app gives users the ability
        to set or update their location and contacts sharing preferences, and
        their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from RAPYD.
        Information on these settings, how to set or change these settings, and
        the effect of turning off these settings are described below.
      </h5>
      <br />
      <h5>(a). Location Information</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        We use rider's device location services to make it easier to get a safe,
        reliable ride whenever you need one. Location data helps improve our
        services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support. You may
        enable/disable, or adjust, our collection of rider location information
        at any time through the Privacy Settings menu in the RAPYD app, or via
        the settings on your mobile device. If you disable the device location
        services on your device, your use of the RAPYD app will be affected. For
        example, you will need to manually enter your pick-up or drop-off
        locations. In addition, location information will be collected from the
        driver during your trip and linked to your account, even if you have not
        enabled The Company to collect your location information.

      <br />
      <h5>(b). Share Live Location (Riders)</h5>

        or drop-off locations. In addition, location information will be
        collected from the driver during your trip and linked to your account,
        even if you have not enabled The Company to collect your location
        information.

      <br />
      <h5>(c). Share Live Location (Riders)</h5>
      <br />
      <h5>
        If you have enabled the device location services on your mobile device,
        you may also enable us to share your location with your driver from the
        time you request a ride to the start of your trip. This makes it easier
        for your driver to pick you up. You may enable/disable location sharing
        with your driver at any time through the Privacy Settings menu in the
        Company app. You may use the Company app if you have not enabled
        location sharing, but it may be more difficult for your driver to locate
        you.’

      <h5>11.1.2 DEVICE PERMISSIONS</h5>
      <h5>
        Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of
        device data that apps cannot access without your consent and these
        platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent.
        The iOS platform will alert you the first time the RAPYD app wants
        permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or
        not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the
        permissions that the RAPYD app seeks before you first use the app, and
        your use of the app constitutes your consent.
